Clank
=====

[Ratchet](https://github.com/maker/ratchet), meet Clank.

Clank is an open source HTML/CSS prototyping framework for mobile apps.

Think of it as Twitter Bootstrap but for prototyping native apps.

Project aims
------------

We aim to expand Ratchet with:

* More iOS styles for common use cases (accordions, maps, etc.)
* HTML/CSS styles for Android 4+ ("Ice Cream Sandwich")
* BEM style component based thinking with Web Components in mind using SCSS
* Skinnability using Compass variables

How to use
----------

Run "bower install" to start. This will install the necessary components to run the app.

Run the files on a local webserver so cookies work. Cookies are used to save your viewing preferences.

Compatibility
-------------

Browser support: Chrome only for now.

* Safari functional (flexbox broken)
* Firefox not functional (HTML5 range input broken)
