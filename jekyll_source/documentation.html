      <h3 id="what-is">What is Clank?</h3>
      <p>Clank is an open source prototyping framework for mobile apps. Think of it as Twitter Bootstrap but for prototyping native apps.</p>
  
      <hr>
  
      <h3 id="why">Why Clank?</h3>
      <h4>Actually looks like a native app</h4>
      <p>We strive to actually look like a native app (as far as web tech allows us to go) instead of pseudo implementations.</p>
      <h4>Component based: pick and choose</h4>
      <p>Clank is a collection of HTML/CSS components. For example, a button is a component. It has it's own SCSS file: <code>components/_button.scss</a></code>.</p>
      <p>Every component stands on its own and can't influence other components. Clank has <a href="component_naming.php">strong rules</a> on component naming to avoid any style clashes.</p>
      <p>A good component only defines layout and provide hooks for specific looks.</p>
      <h4>Handling the look</h4>
      <p>Clank uses variables in SCSS to provide an easy way to skin Clank-made applications to your needs. Changing the global color of headers, bars and buttons is as easy as changing one variable:</p>
  
      {% highlight scss %}  $accent-color: red{% endhighlight %}

      <h4>Variables for cross platform design</h4>
      <p>On Android, it makes sense to go flat and follow the look provided by ICS. On iOS, there's more gradients, strokes and subtle and inset shadows. Clank acknowledges that you are building for multiple platforms. We see each part of the design as a variable that can be altered:</p>
  
{% highlight scss %}  $functional-shadows: true
  $decorational-shadows: false{% endhighlight %}

      <p>Sometimes in more detail:</p>
  
      {% highlight scss %}  $border-radius: 4px;{% endhighlight %}
  
      <p>You also want to switch on a functional level i.e. you might want to swap out an iOS header for an Android action bar component. More on this in <a href="#">component includes</a>.</p>
      <h4>Philosophy</h4>
      <p>You should try to make your application using standard components. The standard components used in iOS and Android have a lot of work behind them. Face it, you don't have 2 weeks to perfect a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>.</p>

      <hr>
  
      <h3 id="support">Support</h3>
      <p>It's not advisable to use Clank for production work since it only supports new and modern browsers like <em>Google Chrome</em>. A lot of the techniques used in Clank depend on newer CSS properties such as Flexbox. For now, Clank is a prototyping tool and testbed for modern web technologies.</p>

      <hr />
  
      <h3 id="css-conventions">CSS conventions</h3>
      <p>Every component should be prefixed with <code>cl-</code>:</p>
      {% highlight scss %}.cl-accordion { }{% endhighlight %}
      <p>This is verbose but the only way to not clash with other libraries until Web Components are commonplace.</p>
      <p>A child element dependent on the component should be added with a hyphen:</p>
      {% highlight scss %}.cl-accordion-item { }{% endhighlight %}
      <p>State should be added with a double underscore:</p>
      {% highlight scss %}.cl-accordion-item__disabled { }{% endhighlight %}
      <p>This prevents too many nested selectors in SCSS.</p>
      <p>This naming technique has been coined <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/">BEM</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="component-headers-footers">Component: headers &amp; footers</h3>
      
      <p class="intro">This page is about the headers and footers component. Adding headers and footers is as simple as adding specific markup.</p>
      <h4>Adding a title bar</h4>
      <p>Add header markup as a direct descendant of a <code>.cl-page</code>:</p>
      {% highlight html %}<div class="cl-bar-title"></div>{% endhighlight %}
      <h4>Adding a footer</h4>
      <p>Add a footer as a direct descendant of a  <code>.cl-page</code>:</p>
      {% highlight html %}<div class="cl-bar-footer"></div>{% endhighlight %}
      <h4>Adding another bar</h4>
      <p>Add a bar as direct descendant of <code>.cl-content</code>:</p>
      {% highlight html %}<div class="cl-bar"></div>{% endhighlight %}

      <h3 id="generators">Generators</h3>

      <p><em>Note that generators are a work in progress and they do not exist yet</em>.</p>
      
      <h4>What is a generator?</h4>
      <p>A generator is simply a bash script that generates code for you. This makes it easy to, for example, add new screens or components to your project.</p>
      <h4>Available generators</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>generate-page.sh</strong></p>
          <p>Creates a new page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>generate-component.sh</strong></p>
          <p>Creates a new component.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
