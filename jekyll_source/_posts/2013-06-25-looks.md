My initial goal with Clank was to simulate the "native" look as much as possible but with the iOS7 announcements I can't really stand behind that. The team at Apple made some design decisions that I don't agree with.

I decided it's better to provide a framework with good defaults that I can stand behind instead of chasing ever-changing platform looks. Good UI design will stay. With the <a href="/documentation.html#skinning-mechanism">skinning mechanisms</a> in Clank you can quickly customize the look however you want.

With <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/partners/">Firefox</a> OS coming up (where every app is built with HTML/CSS/JS), this decision seems like the logical thing to do.
